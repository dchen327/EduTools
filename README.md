# EduTools
## Inspiration
As the COVID19 pandemic worsens globally, online learning has severely impacted inequality as schools are forced to decide between putting lives at risk and providing an accessible education. 

Phone ownership is vastly more widespread than consistent internet access. Just 6% of children in eastern and southern Africa have access to the internet, yet cell phone ownership can be as high as 82%.

## What it does:
EduTools makes traditional online learning accessible without the need of internet access, all you need is a basic phone. 

## How I built it:
- Twilio API to receive/send SMS messages
- Flask backend to process and organize communcation
- State of the art natural language processing APIs for Wikipedia, translation, and grammar checking, OCR & Wolfram|Alpha for math solving

## Challenges:
- Many APIs are out of date, so we had to modify and customize many queries to ensure proper functionality and error handling
- Integration of OCR and Wolfram|Alpha was difficult, and we needed to tune settings to optimize both image recognition and equation solving, and fitting everything into a text message
